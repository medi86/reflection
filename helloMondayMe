TDD equals Test Driven Development. TDD makes your code much precise and saves you
from many errors you would have.
TDD will run multiple tests to make sure it's safe to push, yet it might looks like
run TDD just slow downs the whole process because it needs much time to write the tests
.However, it will save much time and actual money from getting error after the program
is published?released?.
Also, TDD helps to break down big picture into small blocks, so we can solve or programming
step by step.
