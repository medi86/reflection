It's already been 2weeks since the codeplatoon stared. From that 2weeks,I've learned
 a lot of things, vim, shell(fish),and Ruby. First week, I strugle to dealing with this chromebook
I remember how it was painful to watch all that errors before even start the actual class :/

Later on week, we start learn Ruby, 6 basic structures, hash array nil integer boolean string,
concepts were not that hard to understand, but when Josh brought up that nightmare stuff (which brings 1000 arrays in array kinda stufff like that..)
it was a nightmare. If I carefully counted it, I should have able to figure it out, but it's a  big chunk of data made me confusing.
2nd week, more concentrate on Ruby, it's structure of  object, class, binding, how they interact each other. and object orinted programming, which I'm
still strugling to understand it.
I would have asked to me that whats the most difficult thing in those past 2weeks, and my answer would be thinking positively and being more curious about things that
you don't understand. It was a pain that I couldn't understand everthing at that time, but it's normal that you can't understand everthing at first. it's hard to admit
failures and errors, but you have to be friend with those guys.
